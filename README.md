# Multi-view PIFuHD Using the Single-view Pretrained Model

[PIFuHD](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFuHD/) only provides a pretrained model for single-view (frontal) image 3D reconstruction. This repository extends its functionality to support 3D reconstruction from multi-view (frontal/backside) images, employing the same pretrained single-view model. "Zeroshot" multi-view 3D reconstruction is achievable by modifying the image processing pipelines and applying channel-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). This multi-view approach enhances the detail on the backside of the 3D mesh.

The sample images are in 'sample_images' folder. The rendering and mesh [source](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rp-dennis-posed-004-100k-d9ddefd2ac68455fac8720256965c5f1/)

## Setup
Please refer to the original [PIFuHD](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFuHD/) repository for setup instructions, which include package installation and downloading the pretrained model.

## Preprocessing
For 3D reconstruction, a {frontal_image_name}_rect.txt file is required. If the input images are center-aligned, a .txt file with the contents '0 0 {image_height} {image_width}' should suffice.
If the input images are not centered-aligned, refer to the original [Testing section](https://shunsukesaito.github.io/PIFuHD/) to obtain `{frontal_image_name}_rect.txt`. 

## Testing
Run the following command for testing:
```
python -m apps.simple_test -i {folder_containing_images_and_rect} -b {path_of_backside_image} --use_rect 
```
